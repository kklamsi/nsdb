Please answer the following questions for the respective checkpoints:

    group member that was spent working on the checkpoint.
  \item Are there any hints/references we should give future students?
    Conversely, did you find any of our guidance misleading?
  \item Do you have any suggestions for the instructors to more effectively
    support students?
  \item How about the grading scheme? Was it unambiguous and fair?
  \item Any other comments (regarding, for example, the report template, the
